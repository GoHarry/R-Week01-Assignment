Problem 1:
The solution for the first problem calculates factorial using while loop. variable a contains the number for which factorial needs to be calculated. The output is printed using print command.


Problem 2:
The solution for the second problem calculates sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 by 5 using seq() function.


Problem 3:
The solution for the third problem calculates roots of quadractic equation. First discriminant is calculated. Later, roots are calculated if discriminant is greater than zero. If discriminant is equal to zero, then single root is calculated and if discriminant is negative, then message is displayed that there are no real roots.
